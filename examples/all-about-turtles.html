        <h1>All About Turtles</h1>
        <p>
            Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonia /kɪˈloʊniə/ or Testudines /tɛˈstjuːdɪniːz/. They are characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield. Colloquially, the word "turtle" is generally restricted to fresh-water and sea-dwelling Testudines. Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. Its earliest known members date from the Middle Jurassic. Turtles are one of the oldest reptile groups, more ancient than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 360 known extant species, some are highly endangered.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            The common terms "turtle", "tortoise" and "terrapin", depending on the English dialect used, are common names and do not reflect precise biological or taxonomic distinctions. "Turtle" may denote the order as a whole, or a non-monophyletic form taxon within the order, or only aquatic species. "Tortoise" usually means any land-dwelling, non-swimming chelonian. "Terrapin" is used for several species of small, edible, hard-shell turtles, typically those found in brackish waters.
        </p>
        <h2>Human Culture</h2>
        <p>
            Some turtles, particularly small terrestrial and freshwater turtles, are kept as pets. Among the most popular are Russian tortoises, spur-thighed tortoises, and red-eared sliders. In the United States, due to the ease of contracting salmonellosis through casual contact with turtles, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made it illegal to sell turtles under 4 inches (10 cm) long as pets, but many stores and flea markets exploit a loophole which allows turtles under 4 in (100 mm) to be sold for educational purposes.

        <h2>Anatomy</h2>
        <p>
            The largest living chelonian is the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), which reaches a shell length of 200 cm (6.6 ft) and can reach a weight of over 900 kg (2,000 lb). Freshwater turtles are generally smaller. The largest terrestrial species, the Asian softshell turtle (Pelochelys cantorii), produced a few individuals up to 200 cm (6.6 ft). This dwarfs the better-known alligator snapping turtle, the largest chelonian in North America, which attains a shell length of up to 80 cm (2.6 ft) and weighs as much as 113.4 kg (250 lb).
        </p>
        <h2>Ecology & History</h2>
        <p>
            Although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, all turtles and tortoises breathe air and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs. Immersion periods vary between 60 seconds and 1 hour depending on the species. Some turtles spend much or all of their lives on dry land. Aquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is currently being studied. Some species have large cloacal cavities that are lined with many finger-like projections. These projections, called papillae, have a rich blood supply and increase the surface area of the cloaca. The turtles can take up dissolved oxygen from the water using these papillae, in much the same way that fish use gills to respire.
